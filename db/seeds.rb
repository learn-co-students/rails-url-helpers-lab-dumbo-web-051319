# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
Student.create([{first_name: 'Tess', last_name: 'Neau'}, {first_name: 'Grace', last_name: 'Gerber'}, {first_name: 'Tiny', last_name: 'Dancer'}, {first_name: 'Neve', last_name: 'Vene'}])
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)
